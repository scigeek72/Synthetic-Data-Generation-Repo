# Synthetic-Data-Generation-Repo
Contains information (Blog posts, papers and software) about Synthetic Data (mostly Tabular) generation

## Blogs 
-[DataCebo blog](https://datacebo.com/blog/intro-to-sdv/) 
  - Note: Its an open source package. From MIT AI lab. 
  - It is interesting since it can generate synthetic data which often beats the data quality generated by VAEs.

## Papers
-[Modeling Tabular data using Conditional GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf) by Xiu, Skoularidou, Cuesta-Infante, Veeramachaneni 
  - Note: The paper claims that in tabular data, continuous features often fails to be Gaussian. When min-max transformation is used, it often lead to **vaninshing gradient problem**. [pp 3 (Non-Gaussian distribution)]
